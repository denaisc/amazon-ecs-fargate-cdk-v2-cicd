    <h1 style="font-size: 72px;">Always Pay Your Technical Debt</h1>

    <p>
        Technical debt accrues when code quality is compromised to deliver functionality faster.
    </p>

    <p>
        While shortcuts may save time upfront, neglecting technical debt leads to slower development and increased costs
        down the road.
